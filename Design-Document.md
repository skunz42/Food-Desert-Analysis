Food deserts are often located in urban neighborhoods with low income residents who have limited access to transportation.
It is estimated that over 23.5 million Americans live in food deserts.

This includes languages like Go and JavaScript, APIs such as Google Places and Leaflet, as well as a comprehensive microservice architecture.
